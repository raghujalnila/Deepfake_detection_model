![sample_image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b9422a4-a29c-4998-b7d9-9b5dff6a03bd)
## Project Overview
In an era of rapidly advancing AI-generated imagery, distinguishing between real and fake faces has become increasingly critical. I developed this project using InceptionV3 to detect deepfake and AI-generated faces with remarkable precision.
By creating a sophisticated deep learning model, I aimed to address the growing challenges of digital identity verification and misinformation spread through synthetic imagery. The model meticulously analyzes visual characteristics, uncovering subtle artifacts that reveal an image's synthetic origin.
My solution provides a powerful mechanism to verify the authenticity of facial images in an increasingly complex digital landscape, offering a crucial tool for researchers and cybersecurity professionals.

### Detection Capabilities
  **Strong Performance**: Excellent at detecting synthetic images from:
                         - "This Person Doesn't Exist"
                          - DALL¬∑E generated faces
                          - Various StyleGAN outputs
                          
### Current Limitations
                          
  **Challenge**: Limited detection of ChatGPT-generated images due to dataset constraints
    
  **Future Goal**: Expand training data to improve detection of emerging AI image generation techniques
